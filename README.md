# MicrosoftFabricMonitoringHubAPIHack
Hidden insights from Microsoft Fabric with this unofficial Monitoring Hub API hack! This Python script uses Pandas to fetch, clean, and analyze job history data from an undocumented endpoint. Track run times, outcomes, and ownership with ease.

Fabric Monitoring Hub API Hack
Microsoft Fabric Doesnâ€™t Show You This - But It Should! ðŸ˜‰
Overview
In any data platform, especially something as integrated as Microsoft Fabric, it's super important to know whatâ€™s running in the backgroundâ€”whether it's a Synapse Notebook, Data Factory Pipeline, Lakehouse job, or something else. You need to see when a job ran, who triggered it, how long it took, whether it succeeded or failed, and if it failed, why.
The problem is, Fabric doesnâ€™t yet offer a clear, built-in way to explore this. The data exists in the Monitoring Hub, but itâ€™s not developer/user-friendly to access or analyze, especially if you want to spot failures, track durations, or understand usage patterns over time.
This project provides a simple solution using Python and Pandas. It connects to the unofficial Monitoring Hub API, pulls job history, cleans it up, and adds useful insights like job durations, outcomes, and ownership. Now you have a clear view of everything that ran, and itâ€™s actually super nice!
Disclaimer
This is not an official API from Microsoft. The API request URL was discovered using browser developer tools (Inspect Element â†’ Network tab). Use at your own risk, as Microsoft may change or disable this endpoint without notice.
Prerequisites

A Microsoft Fabric account with access to the Monitoring Hub.
A valid authentication token (e.g., retrieved via Azure AD or Fabric notebook environment).

How to Find the Monitoring Hub API URL in Microsoft Fabric
Follow these steps to locate the unofficial Monitoring Hub API URL using your browser's developer tools:

1. Start on the Fabric Home Page
Open Microsoft Fabric in your browser and navigate to the Home page.
2.Access Developer Tools
Right-click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect," or press Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Option+I (Mac) to open the developer tools.
3. Go to the Network Tab
In the developer tools, switch to the "Network" tab to monitor network activity.
4. Navigate to the Monitoring Hub
In Fabric, click on the "Monitoring Hub" section. This will trigger new network requests, which will appear in the Network tab.
5. Locate the "Histories" Request
Scroll through the list of network requests and look for one containing "histories" in the URL (e.g., .../metadata/monitoringhub/histories). Click on this request to view its details, including the full URL and response data.
